"""Map sources: a scene's road geometry as typed segments in the simulator frame.

A map source produces one array of shape ``(N, 7)``: ``[x0, y0, z0, x1, y1, z1, class]``,
each row a single 3D segment carrying one of the five drawable classes. That is
exactly the road entity the renderer takes (``POLY_ROAD_ENTITY_FIELDS``), so nothing
downstream has to know which source produced it.

There are two, because HUGSIM's HD map coverage is thin. :class:`TrajdataMapSource` reads
the real vector map through the same trajdata handle the traffic planner uses, and applies
to the nuScenes scenes whose scenario sets ``load_HD_map``. :class:`GroundTrajectoryMapSource`
applies to every scene: it takes the recorded drive as a lane centerline and measures the
road edges off the ground Gaussians, which are the only description of the drivable surface
the other three datasets carry.

Coordinates
-----------
Three frames meet here, so they are named throughout:

``world``
    The Gaussian model's frame. Y points down; the planner tracks ego as ``(X, Z)``.
``planner``
    The ``(a, b) = (X, Z)`` pair the planner and :class:`~sim.utils.plan.UnifiedMap` use.
``sim``
    The frame ``ego_box`` and ``obj_boxes`` are written in: ``x = b``, ``y = -a``,
    ``z`` up. the world convention every source returns.
