"""Cache the scene-level half of the abstract scene export next to the scene.

Neither the road geometry nor the parked cars move: they are properties of the reconstructed
scene, not of the scenario, the ego or the episode. Deriving them costs a sweep of the
Gaussian renderer plus a clustering pass, which is tens of seconds every time an episode
starts and identical every time. This writes the result beside the scene model and reads it
back on the next run.

The risk with any cache is silently serving a stale answer after the code that produced it
has changed -- which is the shape of the very bugs this export has already had. So nothing is
keyed on the scene alone: the fingerprint covers every constant that steers the result, and a
mismatch is a miss, not a warning. Change a threshold and the next run recomputes.

The sidecar lives in the scene's own directory when that is writable, because it belongs to
the scene; otherwise under ``$HUGSIM_SCENE_EXPORT_CACHE`` or ``~/.cache/hugsim_scene_export``.
