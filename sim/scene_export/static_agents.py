"""Recover the vehicles baked into a scene's background reconstruction as boxes.

HUGSIM's dynamic actors are the ones a scenario inserts: one or two 3DRealCar models driven
by the planner. Everything else on the street -- every parked car, every vehicle that was
standing still when the scene was recorded -- is part of the static Gaussian model. The
Gaussian renderer shows them, so they are in the photorealistic observation the other AD
sides consume, but nothing described them as geometry, so the abstract export shipped
an empty street with one car on it.

That gap is not cosmetic. ``HUGSimEnv`` builds its background collision set from exactly
these Gaussians (``semantic > 1 & != 10 & opacity > 0.8``, which includes the vehicle
classes) and ``bg_collision_det`` ends the episode on contact. Without this module the
policy is failing episodes on obstacles its observation never showed it, which is not a
mistake it can learn its way out of.

The scene models carry a Cityscapes label per Gaussian, so the vehicles can be selected
directly; what is left is turning a labelled point cloud into instances and instances into
oriented boxes. Both steps are approximations, and the rejection rules at the end are what
keep an approximation from inventing an obstacle that is not there.
